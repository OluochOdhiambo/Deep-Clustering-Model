## Description
Access to labelled data is often an issue in a majority of machine learning problems hence the relative popularity of unsupervised learning and more specifically clustering models which work by grouping data based on similarity of features observed. Image data suffers from high dimensionality which reduces the effectiveness of traditional clustering models such as kMeans. Dimesionality reduction is especially important to help the model to learn the important features for creating clusters hence the implementation of an autoencoder for this project. The features from the autoencoder are passed to a clustering layer whose centers are initiated using kmeans and fine-tuned as part of a deep clustering model.
